# tectd — Tect V2.1 foundation

A Rust daemon with PostgreSQL as the canonical store. A workspace is a logical
database object. Its identity comes from an authenticated tenant and an explicit
workspace key; it has no workspace directory or workspace Git worktree.

This repository implements the first V2.1 Scope. The current installed Tect plugin
continues to govern its development. Installing or replacing that plugin is a
separate operation.

The first vertical exposes `get_state {}` and `open_workspace {}` through a native
session MCP bridge. `get_state` does not create or update records. Bootstrap is
atomic and idempotent. Source repository/worktree selection and recovery/performance
acceptance are the ordered next verticals within this Scope.

## Architecture

```mermaid
flowchart LR
  Host[Native Codex session] --> MCP[tect-mcp: stdio]
  MCP --> Daemon[tectd: private Unix socket]
  Daemon --> App[Application use cases and ports]
  App --> Domain[Pure domain values and invariants]
  PG[SQLx adapter] --> App
  PG --> DB[(PostgreSQL)]
  Admin[tect-admin: operator only] --> DB
```

`tect-domain` and `tect-application` cannot depend on persistence or host adapters.
The application owns authorization order and transaction boundaries. SQLx stays in
`tect-postgres`; environment, files, processes and protocol stay in `tect-host`.
The composition binaries wire them together. Run `scripts/check-architecture.py`
to enforce the dependency allowlist, inner-crate I/O boundary and 500-line limit.

## Local configuration

Build with Rust 1.93.0 (`rust-toolchain.toml`), SQLx 0.8.6 and PostgreSQL 18.6.
Create a dedicated database and a separate login role with `NOSUPERUSER`,
`NOBYPASSRLS` and no schema ownership. The migration command grants that role only
its required table/function privileges. The daemon refuses an owner or superuser
connection. Keep admin and runtime connection URLs outside source control.

The operator runs `tect-admin migrate --runtime-role ROLE` with
`TECT_ADMIN_DATABASE_URL`, then `tect-admin enroll --out /absolute/private/host.json`.
Enrollment creates a tenant and owner, or uses an explicitly supplied existing
`--tenant UUID`. Repeated `--source-root /absolute/path` arguments declare the host's
allowed repository locations; an empty list permits zero-source bootstrap.
The generated host credential file must remain private and must not be printed.

`tectd` requires `TECT_DATABASE_URL` and `TECT_SOCKET`. The socket must be a new
absolute path inside a private directory. The daemon does not overwrite an existing
socket or manage another process. `tect-mcp` requires:

| Host setting | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `TECT_SOCKET` | Private daemon socket |
| `TECT_HOST_CONFIG` | Absolute, non-symlinked, mode-0600 enrollment file |
| `TECT_WORKSPACE_KEY` | Explicit logical key, 1–128 ASCII letters/digits/`.`/`_`/`-`, beginning with a letter/digit |
| `CODEX_SESSION_ID` / `CODEX_THREAD_ID` | Native host identity; both must agree when present |

These fields belong to host configuration, not tool arguments. Missing or ambiguous
native identity fails closed. A different key with the same native session is
rejected rather than silently moving the session. On macOS, resolve `<temporary-directory>` or `/var`
aliases to their canonical paths before configuring private files and sockets.

The MCP bridge uses the [MCP lifecycle](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2025-03-26/basic/lifecycle)
and [structured tool results](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2025-06-18/server/tools).
Direct execution of this bridge validates the production transport path; it does
not install a new plugin into the desktop app.

## Verification

Set `TECT_TEST_ADMIN_URL`, `TECT_TEST_RUNTIME_URL` and `TECT_TEST_RUNTIME_ROLE` to
an isolated PostgreSQL database. Tests migrate that database and create fresh
tenants, hosts and workspace fixtures. Never point them at a live database.

```sh
python3 scripts/check-architecture.py
cargo fmt --all --check
cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings
cargo test --workspace
```

Integration tests use real PostgreSQL and the real stdio MCP binary. Their synthetic
native IDs are fixture identities. The separate Scope proof records the inherited
native ID from the actual Codex session, without replacing it in the environment.
Local proof, remote CI, plugin installation and deployment are separate results.
